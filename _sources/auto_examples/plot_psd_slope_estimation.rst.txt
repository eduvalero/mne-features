===================================================================
Estimation of the slope and intercept of the Power Spectral Density
===================================================================

This example aims at showing how the utility function `power_spectrum` and 
the feature function :func:`mne_features.univariate.compute_spect_slope` can 
be used to estimate the slope and the intercept of the Power Spectral 
Density (PSD, computed - by default - using Welch method).

The code for this example is based on the method proposed in:

Jean-Baptiste SCHIRATTI, Jean-Eudes LE DOUGET, Michel LE VAN QUYEN,
Slim ESSID, Alexandre GRAMFORT,
"An ensemble learning approach to detect epileptic seizures from long
intracranial EEG recordings"
Proc. IEEE ICASSP Conf. 2018

.. note::

    This example is for illustration purposes, as other methods
    may lead to more robust/reliable estimation of the slope and intercept 
    of the PSD.

Let us import the data using MNE-Python and epoch it:


.. code-block:: default


    data_path = sample.data_path()
    raw_fname = data_path + '/MEG/sample/sample_audvis_filt-0-40_raw.fif'
    event_fname = data_path + '/MEG/sample/sample_audvis_filt-0-40_raw-eve.fif'
    tmin, tmax = -0.2, 0.5
    event_id = dict(aud_l=1, vis_l=3)

    # Setup for reading the raw data
    raw = mne.io.read_raw_fif(raw_fname, preload=True)
    raw.filter(.5, None, fir_design='firwin')

Estimate the slope (and the intercept) of the PSD. We use here a single
MEG channel during the full recording to estimate the slope and the
intercept.


.. code-block:: default


    data, _ = raw[1, :2048]
    sfreq = raw.info['sfreq']

    # Compute the (one-sided) PSD using Welch method. The ``mask`` variable allows
    # to select only the part of the PSD which corresponds to frequencies between
    # 0.1Hz and 40Hz (the data used in this example is already low-pass filtered
    # at 40Hz).
    psd, freqs = power_spectrum(sfreq, data)
    mask = np.logical_and(1 <= freqs, freqs <= 40)
    psd, freqs = psd[0, mask], freqs[mask]

    # Estimate the slope (and the intercept) of the PSD. The function
    # :func:`compute_spect_slope` assumes that the PSD of the signal is of the
    # form: ``psd[f] = b / (f ** a)``. The coefficients a and b are respectively
    # called *slope* and *intercept* of the Power Spectral Density. The values of
    # the variables ``slope`` and ``intercept`` differ from the values returned
    # by ``compute_spect_slope`` because, in the feature function, the linear
    # regression fit is done in the log10-log10 scale.
    intercept, slope, _, _ = compute_spect_slope(sfreq, data, fmin=1., fmax=40.)
    print('The estimated slope is a = %1.2f and the estimated intercept is '
          'b = %1.3e' % (slope, intercept))

    # Plot the PSD together with the ``b + a * f`` straight line (estimated decay
    # of the PSD with frequency in the log10-log10 scale).
